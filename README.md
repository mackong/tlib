# tlib
A simple and tiny c library includes some common data structures and algorithms.
This is inspired by [Mastering Algorithms with C](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Algorithms-C-Kyle-Loudon/dp/1565924533).

## Dependencies
The library itself is written in ANSI c *without* any other library dependencies.

But if you want to run the unit test, you should have [Check](http://check.sourceforge.net/) library with version >= 0.9.10 installed.

## How to use it
Type
```
make
```
to compile the library and unit test code.

```
make run
```
to run the unit test.
